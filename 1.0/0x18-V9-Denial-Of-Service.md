# V9: Denial of service

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The contract logic prevents influencing the availability of the contract.

Category “V9” lists requirements related to the possible denial of service of the smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **9.1** | Verify that the self-destruct functionality is used only if necessary. | 
| **9.2** | Verify that the business logic does not block its flows when any of the participants is absent forever.  | 
| **9.3** | Verify that the contract logic does not disincentivize users to use contracts (e.g. the cost of transaction is higher that the profit). | 
| **9.4** | Verify that the expressions of functions assert or require to have a passing variant. | 
| **9.5** | Verify that if the fallback function is not callable by anyone, it is not blocking the functionalities of contract and the contract is not vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks. | 
| **9.6** | Verify that the function calls to external contracts (e.g. *send*, *call*) are not the arguments of *require* and *assert* functions. |
