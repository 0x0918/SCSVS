## Introduction

Smart Contract Security Verification Standard is a FREE 11-part checklist created to standardize the security of smart contracts for developers, architects, security reviewers and vendors.
This list helps to avoid the majority of known security problems and vulnerabilities by providing guidance at every stage of the development cycle of the smart contracts (from designing to implementation).

Objectives:
* Help to develop high quality code of the smart contracts.
* Help to mitigate known vulnerabilities by design.
* Provide a checklist for security reviewers.
* Provide a clear and reliable assessment of how secure the smart contract is in the relation to the percentage of SCSVS coverage.

The entire checklist is in a form similar to OWASP APPLICATION SECURITY VERIFICATION STANDARD v4.0.
Every category has a brief description of the control objectives and a list of security verification requirements.

Key areas that have been included:
* V1: ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN AND THREAT MODELLING
* V2: ACCESS CONTROL
* V3: BLOCKCHAIN DATA
* V4: COMMUNICATIONS
* V5: ARITHMETIC
* V6: MALICIOUS INPUT HANDLING
* V7: GAS USAGE & LIMITATIONS
* V8: BUSINESS LOGIC
* V9: DENIAL OF SERVICE
* V10: TOKEN
* V11: CODE CLARITY
