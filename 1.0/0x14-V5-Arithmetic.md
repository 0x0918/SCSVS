# V5: Arithmetic

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high level requirements:
* TODO

Category “V5” lists requirements related to the arithmetic operations of the smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |  Since |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| **5.1** | Verify that the values and math operations are resistant to integer overflows. Use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. | 1.0 |
| **5.2** | Verify that the extreme values (e.g. maximum and minimum values of the variable type) are considered and does change the logic flow of the contract. | 1.0 |
| **5.3** | Verify that non-strict inequality is used for balance equality. | 1.0 |
